# customer-churn
This project is Customer churn for Telco gotten from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).  

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict which customers are likely to churn (i.e., stop doing business with a company) in the future using different classification models.


### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python


## Project Description
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the loss of customers over time. 
In the context of machine learning, customer churn prediction is the task of building a model 
that can predict which customers are likely to churn (i.e., stop doing business with a company) in the future.
Will be using Random Forest and Xgboost classifier to make churn predictions and with the use of SHap , 
i will explore the feature importance for explainability of predictions

## Needs of this project
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)
